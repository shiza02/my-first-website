    <h1>Munchkin cat</h1>
    <P id="one">The Munchkin, also known as <i><u>Sausage Cat</u></i> is a breed of cat characterized by its very short legs,
         which are caused by genetic mutation. Compared to many other cat breeds, it is a relatively new breed,
          documented since 1940s and officially recognized in 1991.The Munchkin is considered to be the original breed of dwarf cat.Much controversy erupted over the breed when it
          was recognized by The International Cat Association (TICA) in 1997 
         with critics voicing concerns over potential health and mobility issues. Many pedigree cat associations around the
         world have refused to recognize the Munchkin cat due to the welfare of the breed and severity of the health issues,
         including the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). Breeding of Munchkin cats is prohibited by law in 
         several countries due to these genetic health concerns.</p>

 <h3>Breed creation</h3>
   <p class="my class"> Short-legged cats have been documented a number of times around the world since the 1940s. 
   A British veterinary report in 1944 noted four generations of short-legged cats which were similar to normal cats
    except for the length of the legs. This line disappeared during the Second World War but other short-legged cats 
    were spotted in Russia during 1956 and the United States in the 1970s.</p>
   <p> 
    In 1983, Sandra Hochenedel, a music teacher in Rayville, Louisiana, found two pregnant cats who had been chased
     under a truck by a dog. She kept one of the cats and named her Blackberry and half of her kittens were born 
     short-legged. Hochenedel gave a short-legged male kitten from one of Blackberry's litters to a friend, Kay LaFrance 
     of Monroe, Louisiana, and she named the kitten Toulouse. It is from Blackberry and Toulouse's litter that today's
      Munchkin breed is descended.</p>
    
    <h3>Registry history of Munchkin breed</h3>
    <P>The Munchkin cat was first introduced to the general public in 1991 via a national network televised cat show
         held by The International Cat Association (TICA) in Davis Oklahoma. However, the breed would not be 
         officially recognized at that time. Critics predicted that the breed would develop back, hip and leg problems
          similar to those that plague some Dachshunds. For many years, the Munchkin breed was not accepted in 
          feline competitions due to the controversial breeding. Dr. Solveig Pflueger, a show judge, geneticist,
           and Chairperson of TICA's Genetics Committee was a strong advocate for the official recognition of the breed. 
           Pflueger was also a breeder of Munchkin cats herself, having been initially sent two cats from Hochenedel.
            Amidst much controversy, the Munchkin was proposed as a new breed by foundation breeders Laurie Bobskill and
             Robert Bobskill of Massachusetts and accepted by TICA into its New Breed development program in September 
             1994. One veteran show judge Katherine Crawford resigned in protest, calling the breed an affront to breeders
              with ethics. The Munchkin breed achieved TICA Championship status in May 2003.</P>
    
   <P> Currently, the only registries that fully recognize the breed are TICA and the Southern Africa Cat Council.
    
There is controversy among breeders of pedigree cats as to what genetic mutations are abnormal and potentially
     disadvantageous to the cat. Katie Lisnik, director of cat protection and policy at the Humane Society of the
      United States, has said "Breeding animals for exaggerated physical characteristics, particularly when it 
      compromises overall health, is irresponsible". Several cat registries do not recognize the Munchkin:
       Fédération Internationale Féline, which refuses to recognize what they consider a breed based on a 
       "genetic disease", achondroplasia. The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy likewise refuses to recognize 
       the breed, considering this breed and others like it to be "unacceptable" because they are based on an 
       "abnormal structure or development". The breed is also not recognized by the Cat Fanciers' Association.</P>

   <h3> Breeding ban</h3>
    <P>In order to protect the animal's welfare, several countries and territories have prohibited breeding with Munchkins, 
    including the Netherlands (2014), Scotland, and Victoria (Australia). The Australian Capital Territory
     (a territory of Australia) government considers the munchkin breed to be <i>"malformed animals"</i> and the deliberate
      breeding of them "unacceptable" because of the "genetic health problems associated with such breeding".</p>

   <h3> Characteristics</h3>
    
    <P>Munchkin kitten, 7 months old
    TICA Standards describe the Munchkin as "outgoing, intelligent, and responds well to being handled". Some 
    
    sources state that the shortness of their legs does not interfere with their running and leaping abilities,
     while others state their ability to jump is limited by their condition.
    
    The Munchkin has similar characteristics to normal domestic cats, due to their frequent use as outcrosses. 
    It is a small to medium-sized cat with a moderate body type and medium-plush coat. Male Munchkins typically
     weigh between 6 and 9 pounds (2.7 and 4.1 kg) and are usually larger than female Munchkins, which typically 
     weigh between 4 and 8 pounds (1.8 and 3.6 kg). The hind legs can be slightly longer than the front which creates a
      slight rise from the shoulder to the rump. The legs of the Munchkin may be slightly bowed, although excessive bowing
       is a disqualification in the show ring. Cow-hocked legs are also penalized.
    
    The Munchkin comes in all coat colors and patterns. It also comes in a long-haired variety, which is shown in a
     separate Munchkin Longhair category. The short-haired variety has a medium-plush coat while the long-haired has 
     a semi-long silky coat. TICA rules for outcrossing allows the use of any domestic cat that does not already 
     belong to a recognized breed. Similarity to other breeds is grounds for disqualification. Non-standard Munchkins
      are not allowed to be shown.</P>
